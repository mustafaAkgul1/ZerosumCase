 * 
 * Check the RunnerTest scene.
 * The player (cube) should move forward in the z-axis with constant speed.
 * It should move left and right smoothly with horizontal drag input, without going off the platform. Achieve this however you wish.
 * The camera should follow the player in the z-axis, it should not move in any other axis.
 * The input should be responsive and easy, the output should be independent of the frame rate.
 *
 * Write the necessary code to achieve the described behaviour on mobile devices.
 *
 * Bonus -> Write a shader for the ground platform to achieve a stripe pattern in world space.
 * Check the reference image at Assets/RunnerTest_PlatformGridReference.png
 * The project uses Universal Render Pipeline so you can use HLSL or shader graph. Either one is fine.
 *
 * Share the completed project through GitHub or your favourite git hosting provider.
